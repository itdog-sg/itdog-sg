## What is IT Dog?

### TL;DR: IT Dog is your personal virtual assistant in telegram!

IT Dog is a joke in Hong Kong, looking back to the [dot-com bubble during 1995 - 2001](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), IT petitioners are the gems and when the bubble blasts, the IT petitioners are being treated like a dog.

In 2016, There was a meme "IT Dog, your information are useful!" flooding over the internet, it comes from an educational magazine "Maths and Tech", the term "IT Dog" became controversial as it reflected the IT petitioners in Hong Kong today are like dogs, without respects from fellow colleagues nor your boss.[Source](http://evchk.wikia.com/wiki/IT狗，你的資訊真的很有用)

* Jenny (The girl on the left): IT Dog, your information are useful!

This bot was made for fun only when the IT dog will bark when anyone asks for stupid technical questions in a telegram chat bot.

Eventually, this bot became famous since the interaction with people is hilarious. A lot of people even not realise it is not a human!

While the bot was added to a high amount of public groups in Hong Kong Telegram community, the author [@mysqli_real_escape_string](https://t.me/mysqli_rel_escape_string) realise this bot may actually provide handy and useful information like the girl Jenny said, "IT Dog, your information are useful!". Hence, weather information, news and train distribution information are added.

However, these data are only useful in Hong Kong and the author is actually living in Singapore, so the Singapore Edition with localised information is out.


## So what IT Dog can do?

Currently, IT Dog Singapore Edition can do the following things:

* Weather Forecast (2 Hour Nowcast provided by NEA)
` What is the weather today? `
* Bus Arrival Information (by LTA)
```  Bus (Bus Service Number) at (Bus Stop Number)

```

not sure what to type?just ask "Hey it dog!"
```
